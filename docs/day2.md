Working with images: computer vision intro
- tasks

- understanding image data and how it is different from text:
    - what are image features: **Image features are the key attributes or characteristics of an image that can be used for analysis and interpretation. These features can include edges, textures, shapes, and colors, which help in understanding the content of the image.**
    edges are defined as areas with significant intensity changes, example of that is a boundary between two different colors or textures.
    - channels, height, width
    - RGB vs grayscale
    - pixel values (0-255) and normalization (0-1)
    - common image file formats (JPEG, PNG)

image datasets as folders of images + csv file with labels

common issues with image data:
- varying sizes and aspect ratios
- different lighting conditions
- occlusions and background clutter 
- common datasets limitations such as small sample size, lack of diversity, and annotation errors. Remedies include:
- image augmentations to increase dataset size and variability (flipping, rotation, cropping, color jitter)
- transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models on large datasets. Transfer learning involves taking a model trained on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This approach helps improve performance when data is limited.

Knowedge destilation is a technique where a smaller model (student) is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model (teacher). This is useful for deploying models on resource-constrained devices.

Talking about models:
- old school computer vision techniques (SIFT, HOG)
- CNNs: convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers
- popular architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception
- transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., using
