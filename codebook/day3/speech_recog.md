# Speech Recognition with LibriSpeech Dataset
## Overview

LibriSpeech Dataset for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
LibriSpeech is a large-scale corpus of read English speech, comprising approximately 1,000 hours of audio at 16 kHz, derived from LibriVox audiobooks. It's widely used for training and evaluating ASR systems. Download the dataset from the official OpenSLR site: https://www.openslr.org/12 (includes multiple splits like train-clean-100, dev-other, etc.). It's also hosted on Hugging Face for easy integration: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openslr/librispeech_asr.
